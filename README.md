# elvui-updater
A simple script that scrapes the ElvUI download page's HTML and downloads/extracts the latest version of ElvUI to your Retail addons directory.

I wrote this script in tandem with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to test the capabilities of the AI by solving a minor inconvenience 
for me:  having ElvUI be the only wow addon that can't be managed by Curseforge.

This was not written with the intention of it being used by other people; I'm mostly storing it here for my own safety as a backup.

That said, if you have interest in contributing to make it more configurable, more efficient, or safer, then go right ahead!  If you just have 
suggestions,  you can create an issue if you want but I'm not going to promise anything as this is kind of a one-off bodge job that was 
intended to be sort of duct taped together.
